# tower-defense
An implementation of a tower defense game based on Bloons Tower Defense 4

This version includes about half the towers in the original game. It supports loading and saving games by username, and as of now only includes one map and one difficulty level. However, the map is read in as a text file and so is easily scalable. 

The main class of the game is Game.java. The detailed rules are given by the Rules button within the game.
